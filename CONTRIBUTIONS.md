# :hammer_and_wrench: Contributing to This Project

Thank you for contributing! I welcome contributions from everyone. However, to ensure a smooth experience, please follow the stebs below before you start coding!

## :clipboard: Contribution Process

**1. Create an Issue**
- Open a new GitHub Issue to propose a feature or report a bug.
- Provide a **Problem Statement**, **Proposed Solution**, **Acceptance Criteria**
- (Optional) Provide additional information, like anticipated **Difficulty** or anything else you might want to add.

**2. Create a Feature Branch**
- Branch off of `main` using a name in the format: 'feature' or 'bugfix'/two letter code to fuzzy identify yourself (doesn't have to be your real name)/issue number/30 character max description.
- Example: `feature/ds/1/contributions-style-guide`, `bugfix/lf/21/fixing-car-accel-bug` are two acceptable branch names, the first by me (Dakota Schaeffer) and the second by somebody who wishes to remain anonymous going by 'lordfarquad'.

**3. Link the Branch to the Issue**
- All branches must be linked to an issue to be accepted in a pull request.
- Add the branch in the GitHub Issue under the Development section.

**4. Make Pull Request**
- Push your branch and open a PR to `main`.
- Reference the issue again using `Fixes #<issue-number>` or `Closes #<issue-number>`.
- Make sure you mark elements of the **Acceptance Criteria** that are completed. If some or all elements are not completed, tell us why and why you think the PR should go ahead anyway.
- Make sure that your code follows our coding style.

## :necktie: Milestones Formatting

There probably won't be many people who are making milestones. In fact its probably just me. But in case someone wants to help me with it here is what I had in mind. 
- **The conclusion comes first** You should immediately explain what should be different after the milestone ends. 
- **Less is More** Do not make sections, do not try to explain logic. Keep it less than 160 words.
