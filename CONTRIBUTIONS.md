Thank you for contributing! I welcome contributions from everyone. However, to ensure a smooth experience, please follow the stebs below before you start coding!

## :clipboard: Contribution Process

**1. Create an Issue**
- Open a new GitHub Issue to propose a feature or report a bug.
- Provide a **Problem Statement**, **Proposed Solution**, **Acceptance Criteria**
- (Optional) Provide additional information, like anticipated **Difficulty** or anything else you might want to add.

**2. Create a Feature Branch**
- Branch off of `main` using a name in the format: 'feature' or 'bugfix'/two letter code to fuzzy identify yourself (doesn't have to be your real name)/issue number/30 character max description.
- Example: `feature/ds/1/contributions-style-guide`, `bugfix/lf/21/fixing-car-accel-bug` are two acceptable branch names, the first by me (Dakota Schaeffer) and the second by somebody who wishes to remain anonymous going by 'lordfarquad'.

**3. Link the Branch to the Issue**
- All branches must be linked to an issue to be accepted in a pull request.
- Add the branch in the GitHub Issue under the Development section.

**4. Make Pull Request**
- Push your branch and open a PR to `main`.
- Reference the issue again using `Fixes #<issue-number>` or `Closes #<issue-number>`.
- Make sure you mark elements of the **Acceptance Criteria** that are completed. If some or all elements are not completed, tell us why and why you think the PR should go ahead anyway.
- Make sure that your code follows our coding style.
