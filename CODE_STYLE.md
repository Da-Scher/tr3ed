# :keyboard: Coding Style

Thank you for contributing! I welcome contributions from everyone. However, to ensure a smooth experience, please follow this coding style guide.

## :ballot_box: Variable Naming Convention
- structs and enums must be typedef'd: `typedef struct my_struct {} my_struct;`
- constants and macros must be capitalized: `const float PI = 3.14;`
- pointer asterisk must contact the variable name: `int *xp;`
- variables, functions, and file names must be snake case: `int example_function()`
